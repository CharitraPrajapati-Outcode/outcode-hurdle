# To develop a standup tracking application and work on decoupling trackify access

## Introduction

Standup meetings are a common practice in agile software development where team members gather to provide updates on their work progress, discuss any challenges they are facing, and plan their activities for the day. Standup tracking applications help teams organize and streamline their standup meetings by providing a platform to record meeting notes, track action items, and monitor progress over time.

## Why Decouple Trackify Access?

Decoupling Trackify access from other connected applications offers several benefits:

1. **Enhanced Security**: By decoupling Trackify access, we can ensure that user data is securely managed and accessed only by authorized applications.

2. **Improved Scalability**: Decoupling Trackify access allows for better scalability as each application can manage its own data without relying on a centralized system.

3. **Reduced Complexity**: Decoupling Trackify access simplifies the architecture and reduces dependencies between applications, making it easier to maintain and update each application independently.

4. **Better User Experience**: Decoupling Trackify access can improve the user experience by providing a seamless and consistent interaction with the application without interruptions from other connected apps.

## What Is Decoupling?

Decoupling refers to the process of separating components or services within an application to reduce dependencies and improve flexibility. In the context of Trackify access, decoupling involves isolating Trackify user data from other connected applications to ensure that each application can access and manage its data independently.

## Key Steps to Decouple Trackify Access

- **Identify Dependencies**: Identify the dependencies between Trackify and other connected applications to understand the data flow and interactions.

- **Define APIs**: Define clear and standardized APIs for accessing Trackify data to ensure consistent communication between applications.

- **Implement Authorization**: Implement secure authorization mechanisms to control access to Trackify data and prevent unauthorized access.

- **Test Integration**: Test the integration between Trackify and other applications to ensure that data is transferred securely and accurately.

- **Developing Standup Tracking Application**: Develop a standup tracking application that leverages the decoupled Trackify access to provide a seamless user experience and efficient data management.

By decoupling Trackify access and developing a standup tracking application, we can enhance security, scalability, and user experience while streamlining the standup meeting process for agile teams.

## What is the core functionality of the standup tracking application?

The core functionality of the standup tracking application includes:

1. **User Authentication**: Allow users to log in securely and access their standup meeting data.

2. **Standup Creation**: Enable users to create new standup meetings, add team members, and set meeting agendas.

3. **Meeting Notes**: Provide a platform to record meeting notes, action items, and progress updates during standup meetings.

4. **Action Item Tracking**: Track action items assigned during standup meetings and monitor their progress over time.

5. **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate reports and analytics to visualize team performance, identify bottlenecks, and improve productivity.

6. **Integration with Trackify**: Integrate with Trackify to access user data, track time spent on tasks, and synchronize standup meeting information.

## How will the decoupled Trackify access enhance the application?

Decoupling Trackify access will enhance the standup tracking application by:

1. **Improved Security**: Ensuring that user data from Trackify is accessed securely and independently by the application.

2. **Scalability**: Allowing the application to scale efficiently without relying on a centralized system for data access.

3. **Flexibility**: Enabling the application to adapt to changing requirements and integrate with other services seamlessly.

4. **Performance**: Optimizing data retrieval and processing by decoupling Trackify access and reducing dependencies.

5. **User Experience**: Providing a seamless and consistent user experience by managing Trackify data independently within the application.

By leveraging decoupled Trackify access, the standup tracking application can offer enhanced functionality, security, and performance to agile teams, improving their productivity and collaboration during standup meetings.

## What are the modules and components of the standup tracking application?

The standup tracking application consists of the following modules and components:

1. **User Management**: Handles user authentication, registration, and profile management.

2. **Project Management**: Manages standup meetings, team members, and meeting agendas.

3. **Daily Standups**: Records meeting notes, action items, and progress updates during daily standup meetings.

4. **Action Item Tracking**: Tracks action items assigned during standup meetings and monitors their completion status.

5. **Reporting and Analytics**: Generates reports and analytics to visualize team performance and productivity.

6. **Trackify Integration**: Integrates with Trackify to access user data, track time spent on tasks, and synchronize standup meeting information.


## Application development detail

The standup tracking application is developed using python. Currently, the application is in the development phase and the following features are being implemented:

- List out all roles for user
- List out all projects 
- List out all users with associated projects in metadata

Currently the code is deployed in lambda function. Only dedicated IP addresses with specified secret server key can access the lambda function.
